The mu코拷쁫코코u (愉쓇눇쇓눇; formerly also read as sirru코u, sirrush) or Mushkhushshu (pronounced "Mush췅khush췅shu"), is a creature from ancient Mesopotamian mythology. A mythological hybrid, it is a scaly dragon with hind legs resembling the talons of an eagle, feline fore legs, a long neck and tail, a horned head, a snake-like tongue, and a crest. The mu코拷쁫코코u most famously appears on the reconstructed Ishtar Gate of the city of Babylon, dating to the sixth century BC.

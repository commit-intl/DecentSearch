The Eushta Tatars (Siberian Tatar: яушта, Russian: Эуштинцы) — are one of the three subgroups of Tom Tatar group of Siberian Tatars. Eushta mainly inhabit the lower reaches of the Tom river in Tomsk Oblast. Their historical and cultural centre is the Eushta village. Eushta are especially closely related to Chats.
Eushta are considered to be originally Samoyedic inhabitants of western Siberia, who were greatly influenced by Turkic peoples and lately Turkicised. In the beginning there were migrations from Altai. Yenisei Kyrgyz and Tyolyos tribes formed a role in their ethnogenesis. In 9th and 10th centuries Kimeks arrived in the region, from which the Kipchak people derived, who also had impact on Eushta.
When Russians came into contact with Eushta, they numbered around 800 people.

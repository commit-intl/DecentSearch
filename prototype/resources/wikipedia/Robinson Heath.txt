The Nuclear Utilisation Technology Centre at Robinson Heath is a fictional United Kingdom government research facility featured in the work of David Langford, most notably the novel The Leaky Establishment. It is based largely on his own experience at the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston Heath, Berkshire.
In the Temps shared universe, Robinson Heath also contains the Department of Paranormal Resources' research laboratory. Unfortunately, security concerns mean paranorms are not allowed entry except on MOD business.
The name is a play on the artist Heath Robinson.

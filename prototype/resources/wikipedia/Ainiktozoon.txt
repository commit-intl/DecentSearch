Ainiktozoon loganense is an enigmatic fossil organism from the Silurian of Scotland. Originally described as an early chordate, recent studies suggest that it was in fact an arthropod, more precisely a thylacocephalid crustacean.A. loganense is known from a number of specimens from Silurian rocks (Ludlow series) at Lesmahagow in Scotland.

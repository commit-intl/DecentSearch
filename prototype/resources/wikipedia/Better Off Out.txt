Better Off Out (BOO) is the name of a non-party campaign which called for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union. It is run by The Freedom Association, a pressure group that describes itself as non-partisan, centre-right and libertarian, and which has links to the Conservative Party, The Brexit Party and UK Independence Party (UKIP). The campaign was formed in 2006, and is based in Cheltenham, England.
